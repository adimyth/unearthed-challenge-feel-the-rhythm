# Feel the Rhythm

Solution to [unearthed's feel the rhythm challenge](https://unearthed.solutions/u/competitions/110/).

## Instructions
1. Create different branch for different tasks. Follow the naming convention - `{author}_{task}`. For example - for EDA, my branch name would be `aditya_eda`. This is a temporary format, might change soon.
2. Do not commit to master branch at the moment

**More instructions coming soon**
